#  Write a Python expression that checks if a given number, x, is even and returns "Even" if it is, and "Odd" if it's not.

# x = int(input())
# if x % 2 == 0:
#     print("Even")
# else:
#     print("Odd")


#Write a "for" loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive.
    
# n = int(input())
# for i in range(1,n+1):
#     print(i,end=' ')


# Write a Python program to check if the elements of a given list are unique or not.

# n1 = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 2, 1, 4, 10, 12, 14, 12, 16, 17]
# n2 = int(input())
# print(n2 in n1)
# print(n2 is not n1)


#Write a Python program to remove all elements from a given list that are present in another list.
# list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# pop1 = list1.pop()
# print(pop1)



#Write a Python program to reverse a given list of lists.

# name = [['orange', 'red'], ['green', 'blue'], ['white', 'black', 'pink']]
# name1 = []
# rev = reversed(name)
# for i in rev:
#     name1.append(i)
# print(name1)


# Create a Python function named "calculate_area" that takes the length and width of a rectangle as parameters and returns its area. Call this function with appropriate values and print the result.

# def calculate_area(length, width):
#     print(length * width)
# length = int(input("length = "))
# width = int(input("width = "))
# calculate_area(length,width)
